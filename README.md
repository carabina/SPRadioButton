# SPRadioButton

Steps to use the SPRadioButton:
1. Add a button in storyboard and change its class to "SPRadioButton"
2. Give the button a square size (example -> 25*25, 30 * 30). You got the point right ??
3. Set the color of the button as per your choice and the gap between outer and inner circles of the button using storyboard.
   You will see the changes being reflected as u make them.
